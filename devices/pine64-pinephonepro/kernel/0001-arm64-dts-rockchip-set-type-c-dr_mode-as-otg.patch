Subject: [PATCH 1/3] arm64: dts: rockchip: set type-c dr_mode as otg

This goes against what 75152d66315521a48c4997305f4e01c5f139e160 did,
where they set the rockpro64 type-c to host due to reliability issue.

The change is meant to allow using the type-c port for gadget mode.

The role switch, and role switch mode are meant to allow userspace
control of the mode, using role switch.
